# The sum of all talk durations would fit into 2 tracks,
# but because of the individual durations 3 tracks are actually needed.
# -> Tests wether the algorithm can add tracks after initialization to solve duration overflows.
# -> Tests wether the algorithm respects the Networking Event time constraints
